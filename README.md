# Book-Store-Web-Application
It is an Java Full Stack Web Application here I used Technologies like Springboot, Hibernate, Mysql for Backend and Html , Css, Bootstrap as Frontend and used Thymeleaf and Rest Api to transfer data from Fronted to Backend. Here we can view Books Edit , Update , Delete and Make books to our Wishlist for our favorite Books.
